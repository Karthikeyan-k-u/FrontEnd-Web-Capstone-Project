## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/college-bus-tracker.git
cd college-bus-tracker
2. Open in browser
Simply open index.html in your preferred browser. No server required.

3. (Optional) Serve locally
If you have Python installed:

bash
python -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000
🧭 Usage
For Students / Staff
Home: Quick access to tracking, routes, schedules, and announcements.

Live Tracking: Select a route from the dropdown to see only those buses. Click markers for bus details.

Routes: Browse all available bus routes and their major stops.

Schedules: Search for a route, then expand to see the full stop‑by‑stop timetable with pickup times and driver contact.

Contact: View department info or send a message (demo).

For Developers
Modify bus data: All route information is stored in JavaScript objects inside schedules.html and tracking.js. Update them to match your actual fleet.

Change map center: Edit the setView coordinates in tracking.js (line ~30).

Styling: Adjust CSS variables or override classes in the respective .css files.

⚙️ Customization
What to change	Where to change
College name / branding	index.html (hero text), header logo in all pages
Bus routes & schedules	routes.html (hard‑coded cards), schedules.html (JavaScript routesData array)
Map default location	tracking.js → map.setView([12.93, 80.14], 12)
Announcements	index.html → <section class="announcement">
Contact information	contact.html and index.html contact section
📌 Notes
The live tracking simulation is purely for demonstration. Real‑time GPS integration would require a backend service and WebSocket / Firebase connection.

Driver phone numbers shown are fictional and for example purposes only.

The project uses two tile layers (OSM and CartoDB) as fallback in case one fails.

🔮 Future Enhancements
Connect to a real‑time bus location API

Add user geolocation to show nearest stop

Display route paths on the map (polylines)

Implement a proper backend with database for schedules and feedback

Add PWA support for offline access

Dark mode toggle


## ✅ Summary

The **College Bus Tracker** is a polished, ready‑to‑deploy front‑end project that demonstrates real‑time simulation, responsive design, and clean code organisation. The provided `README.md` gives a complete overview and instructions for anyone cloning the repository.
